# Hugging Face LLMs Toolkit

Welcome to the Hugging Face LLMs Toolkit repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for utilizing state-of-the-art Language Model Models (LLMs) from Hugging Face across various domains including NLP, Audio Processing, Image Processing, Multimodal model querying, and Deployment on the Hugging Face Spaces platform. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast, this toolkit aims to provide you with a suite of Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) explaining the detailed usage of these models.

## Overview

This repository is organized into different sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of leveraging Hugging Face's LLMs. Here's a brief overview:

- **NLP Models**: Explore how to use pre-trained NLP models for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and more.

- **Audio Processing**: Learn how to utilize Hugging Face models for audio-related tasks such as speech recognition, audio classification, and voice synthesis.

- **Image Processing**: Dive into image processing tasks like image classification, object detection, image to audio generation, and image captioning using Hugging Face models.

- **Multimodal Model Querying**: Discover how to leverage multimodal models for tasks that involve both text and other modalities such as images and audio.

- **Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces**: Understand the process of deploying your models on Hugging Face Spaces, making them accessible and usable by others.

Each section contains detailed Jupyter Notebooks with explanations, code snippets, and examples to guide you through the implementation process.
